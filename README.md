Created this website for Software Engineering. It displays all of my past, present, and future assignments for this course. It provides links to all GitHub Repositories for each assignment.

# Instructions
There are no major functions to the site. Once the page opens it simply contains all the assignments for this course. You can click on the GitHub and Azure Pages links to look at each assignment.
